Hello, teacher!
This message is for you)

I am going to create a game for blind people called "2nd sense" that will randomly generate a short sound of some animal or character
from a movie and gamer should guess who ar what is that. Also, there will be speech recognition for voice control, however I have one big
problem with that:
If I create an object of speechcalculator class in MainInterfacController, console can't load an fxml file( But if there is no other
objects everything works very good! 

Can you please see my code and tell me what is wrong with it?

THANK YOUUUUU FOR YOUR PRICELESS TIME YOU SPEND ON MY NON-WORKING CODE!
